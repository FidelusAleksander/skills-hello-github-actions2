## Step 2: Add a job to your workflow file

Nice work! :tada: You added a workflow file!

### üìñ Theory: Introduction to jobs

A **job** is a group of steps that run together on the same runner within a workflow. Jobs are defined in the workflow file under the `jobs` section. Each job runs independently by default, but you can configure jobs to depend on each other.

Jobs help you organize your workflow into logical units, such as building, testing, or deploying your code. Each job can run on different environments and can be configured to run in parallel or sequentially.

   on:
     pull_request:
       types: [opened]
   permissions:
     pull-requests: write
   jobs:
