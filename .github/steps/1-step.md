## Step 1: Create a workflow file

Welcome to "Hello GitHub Actions" exercise! :wave:

### üìñ Theory: Introduction to workflows

A **workflow** is an automated process that you define in your repository. Workflows are described in YAML files stored in the `.github/workflows` directory. Each workflow is triggered by specific **events**‚Äîsuch as opening a pull request, pushing code, or creating an issue‚Äîthat happen in your repository.

Workflows let you automate tasks like building, testing, or deploying your code, and can respond to almost any activity in your project.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Create a workflow file

1. Open this repository in a new browser tab so you can work on the steps while you read the instructions in this tab.
1. In the **Code** tab of your repository, create a new branch named `welcome-workflow`.

1. In the `welcome-workflow` branch, navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory.
1. Create a new file named `welcome.yml` in the `.github/workflows` directory with the following content:

   ```yaml
   name: Post welcome comment
   on:
     pull_request:
       types: [opened]
   permissions:
     pull-requests: write
   ```

1. Commit your changes directly to the `welcome-workflow` branch.
1. As you commit your changes Mona will prepare the next step in this exercise!
